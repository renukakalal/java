JDK:-JDK is java development kit.
    -it is used to write and execute the program
    -it have tools+JRE
JRE:JRE is java run time Enviroment
    -it is used to only execute the program
   -it have lib+jvm
JVM:JVM is java virtual machine
   -it is used to execute the program

11)3 operations 
  -1)load the code into the memory
  -2)verify the code
  -3)execute the code

12)java is platform independant because .java which convert into .class which converted into the byte code. it understand by the jvm it is it can write once and execute any operating       system. and also called WORA

13)class:class is which used to create a object.

14)keywords:key words are inbuilt variables in java.we can use when ever we want

   byte     
   short
   int
   long
   float
   double
   char


18)main method:jvm start executing the program when main method is declared.
   

19)static method is used used decleare any datatype and without passing parameters.involked  both static and main method into another method.
syntax:
public static void name_the_method()
{
}

class Calculator
{
public static void num(int variable)
{
if(num/2==0)
{
system.out.println("number is even");
{
else
{
System.out.println("num is odd");
}
public static  void main(String[] args)
{
num(4);
num(7);
}
}
